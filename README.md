# Design-and-Implementation-of-C-Band-LNA-Proof-of-Concept-
This is a repository for Proof of Concept of Design and Implementation of a C band Low Noise Amplifier for Geo Stationary Satellite Communication
# Specifications for C-Band LNA
- 3625 MHz to 4800 MHz
- Noise Figure: < 3dB
- Gain: 60 dB (minimum)
- Input VSWR: 1.30 : 1
- Output VSWR: 1.30 : 1
- Max. Input Power without damage: 0 dBm
- Power Output (@ 1-dB Gain Compression): +10 dBm (minimum)
- Output Third Order Intercept (OIP3): +20 dBm (minimum)
- Temperature Range: 0 to +60 °C
- Ensure the frequency is within the specified range.
- Keep the input power below 0 dBm to prevent damage.
- The amplifier operates optimally in temperatures ranging from 0 to +60 °C.
